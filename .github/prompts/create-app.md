Goal:
Create a JavaScript application to analyze CSV files with both command-line interface and web application capabilities.

Context:
This is a Node.js-based application that provides dual interfaces:
1. Command-line scripts for CSV file operations
2. Web application (React/Next.js) for interactive CSV analysis, generation, and updates
The application needs to be production-ready with proper documentation and responsive design.

Requirements:
- Technology Stack:
  - Node.js for runtime and backend
  - React/Next.js for web application and frontend
  - Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive design
  - Semantic UI (https://semantic-ui.com/) for web application design components
  
- Project Structure:
  - Organized files and folders with clear routing structure
  - Separate directories for CLI scripts, web routes, and backend logic
  
- Features:
  - Command-line interface with executable scripts
  - Web-based dashboard with professional, out-of-the-box appearance
  - CSV file upload functionality
  - CSV data analysis capabilities
  - CSV generation and update features
  
- Documentation:
  - Clear instructions on how to run command-line scripts
  - Documentation for adding new scripts to the project
  - Setup and installation guide

Constraints:
- Must use Node.js as the runtime environment
- Frontend must combine Bootstrap for responsiveness with Semantic UI for design
- All CLI scripts must be executable from command line
- Web application must be accessible via browser
- CSV operations must work both via CLI and web interface

Output Format:
- Well-structured project with clear folder hierarchy
- Separate entry points for CLI and web application
- README.md with comprehensive setup and usage instructions
- Individual script documentation for CLI commands
- Clean, responsive web interface with dashboard as landing page
